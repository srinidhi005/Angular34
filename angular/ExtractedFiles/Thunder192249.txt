We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of 
2
v
 
a
,
America. Those standards require that we plan an0d perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 
3
whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in 
the consolidated financial statements The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, 
including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, 
whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control 
relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order 
to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing 
an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness 
of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation 
of the consolidated financial statements. 
 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our audit opinion.

The Company 
 
Thunder Parent Inc. (the "Company") is a Delaware corporation that was incorporated in January 
2015. On January 15, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of all the outstanding equity of 
Telestream Holdings Corporation ("Telestream"). Telestream specializes in products that make it

l
100% of Telestream GMBH located uin Germany and Telestream UK, Ltd (FKA Vidcheck Ltd), 
J
located in the United Kingdom. Telestream GMBH provides sales and support services to customers 
located in the EMEA region. Telestream UK, Ltd develops and supports the Quality Control

Technologies Hong Kong, Limited, IneoQuest Technologies PTE Ltd., and IneoQuest Technologies 
Mexico. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. 
 
Use of estimates 
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted 
in the United States of America ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and 
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
during the reporting period. Significant estimates include the allocation of purchase price to various 
intangibles at fair value, the useful lives of such intangibles, the Company's assessment of possible 
impairment of its intangibles and long-lived assets, revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful 
accounts, useful lives of long-lived assets, and income taxes. Actual results could differ from those 
estimates.

1. The Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 
 
Revenue recognition 
 
The Company's revenues consist of sales of hardware products (which include required embedded 
software that works together with the hardware to deliver the hardware's essential functionality), 
software license fees and related maintenance and support contracts, and professional services 
 
Revenues are recognized when all of the following conditions are met: 
 
• There is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; 
• Delivery has occurred; 
• The amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable; and 
• Collectability of the fee is reasonably assured. 
 
Multiple-element arrangements are concurrent customer purchases of a combination of the 
l
Company's software, appliance, maintenance anad service offerings that may be delivered at various 
y
i
t
e
n
points in time. For multiple-element arrangements comprised only of hardware products and related 
l
e r
u
d
services, the Company allocates the total arrangement com nsideration to the multiple elements based 
B
ﬁ
n  o
6
r
on each element's estimated selling price compared to the total relative selling price of all the 
o e c 4
c t p. :
s 5
elements. Each element's estimated selling price is based on management's best estimate of selling 
a
e
1
c
v
 
price ("BESP") paid by customers based one the elem0 ent's historical pricing when vendor specific 
l
y
t 2
S n
objective evidence ("VSOE") or third party evid0ence ("TPE") does not exist The Company has 
a
2
v
 
established BESP for product elemeants as the average selling price the element was sold for over the 
,
0
3
past four quarters, whether sold alone or sold as part of a multiple-element transaction The 
 
l
u
Company's internal list price for products with consideration in regards to changing factors in 
J
technology and in the marketplace is generated to target the desired gross margin from sales of 
product after analyzing historical discounting trends. The Company reviews sales of the product 
elements on an annual basis and updates, when appropriate, BESP for such elements to ensure that 
it reflects recent pricing experience. The Company has established VSOE for most of its services 
related elements. 
 
For multiple-element arrangements comprised only of software products and related services, for 
the undelivered elements the Company maintains VSOE for the Company allocates a portion of the 
total arrangement consideration to the undelivered elements, primarily support agreements and 
professional services. The remaining portion of the total arrangement consideration is allocated to 
the delivered software, referred to as the residual method. VSOE of fair value of the undelivered 
elements is based on the price customers pay when the element is sold separately. The Company 
reviews the separate sales of the undelivered elements on a quarterly basis and updates, when 
appropriate, its VSOE of fair value for such elements to ensure that it reflects recent pricing 
experience

Revenue recognition (continued) 
 
If the Company cannot objectively determine the VSOE of the fair value of any undelivered software 
element, revenue is deferred until all elements are delivered and services have been performed, or 
until fair value can objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements In 
arrangements for which services are the only undelivered element, the Company recognizes 
revenues for software upon delivery and maintenance ratably over the maintenance term. 
 
For multiple-element arrangements comprised of a combination of hardware and software elements, 
the total arrangement consideration is bifurcated between the hardware and hardware-related 
deliverables and the software and software-related deliverables based on the relative selling prices 
of all deliverables as a group Then, arrangement consideration for the hardware and hardware-
related services is recognized upon delivery or as the related services are provided as outlined above 
and revenue for the software and software-related services is allocated following the residual method 
and recognized based upon delivery or as the rellated services are provided as outlined above.

are collected in advance via check, wire or credit card upon receipt of an order The Company's 
practice is to not allow its customers to return their software products and enforce the terms of the 
contracts. Past sales returns have been insignificant. 
 
The Company sells its software, appliances, and related maintenance services directly through 
telesales and field sales organizations in North America, Latin America, EMEA and APAC and 
indirectly through distribution partners worldwide. 
 
The Company records the sale of product and services to customers as gross revenue when the 
Company is the principal in the arrangement and net of the associated costs incurred when the 
Company is not considered the principal in the arrangement.

Revenue recognition (continued) 
 
Products may be sold through distributors or resellers in the United States and certain international 
markets. Revenues from software license fees and appliances sold through distributors or resellers 
are generally recognized on the sell-in basis. Such resellers purchase licenses solely for end-user 
arrangements, which are specifically identified on the reseller purchase order, rather than for their 
inventory. The Company grants no refunds or price adjustment rights to its resellers. 
 
Cost of software, appliance, maintenance, and services and other 
 
Cost of software and appliance revenues includes costs associated with software products, hardware 
products, and royalties for third-party embedded software. Cost of maintenance and services and 
other revenues includes costs to provide support and maintenance, largely consisting of salaries and 
related expenses, for customer support personnel, and royalties for third-party embedded software

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, cost being determined on a standard cost basis 
which approximates actual costs of a first-in, first-out ("FIFO") basis and market being determined 
as the lower of replacement cost or net realizable value The Company records write-downs of 
inventories which are obsolete or in excess of anticipated demand or market value based on 
consideration of appliance lifecycle stage, technology trends, appliance development plans and 
assumptions about future demand and market conditions.

Inventories (continued) 
 
Inventories as of December 31, 2017 are composed of approximately $2,766,000 in finished goods 
and approximately $1,680,000 in component parts. 
 
Goodwill and other intangible assets 
 
Goodwill is the excess of costs over fair value of net assets of the business acquired. Goodwill and 
other intangible assets acquired that are determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized 
but are tested for impairment at least annually Intangible assets with estimable useful lives are 
amortized over their respective useful lives and reviewed for impairment. 
 
Other intangible assets are recorded at fair value, net of accumulated amortization. Amortization is 
recognized using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of the assets with the exception 
of customer relationships which are amortized usling an accelerated method

operating results and significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy

for the Company's overall business. Ru ecoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a 
J
comparison of the carrying value of the asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future 
cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the 
asset exceeds its fair value. For the year ended December 31, 2017 no impairment loss was recorded 
related to long-lived assets. 
 
Financial instruments 
 
The Company's consolidated balance sheets includes the following financial instruments: cash, 
accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and debt obligations. The carrying values 
of accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values given 
their short maturities. The fair value of the Company's long-term debt approximates the carrying 
value due to the variable stated rates in these instruments approximating the fair value and the value 
of the collateral underlying these obligations.

Concentration of credit risk 
 
Cash and accounts receivable are financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to credit 
risk. At times, cash balances held at financial institutions were in excess of federally insured limits; 
however, the Company primarily places its temporary cash with high-credit quality financial 
institutions. The Company has not experienced any losses on its deposits of cash. 
 
Trade accounts receivable are recorded at invoiced or to be invoiced amounts and do not bear 
interest The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition 
and, generally, requires no collateral from its customers. An allowance for doubtful accounts was 
established based on various factors including credit profiles of the customers, contractual terms and 
conditions, historical payments and current economic trends. The Company reviews the allowance 
monthly by assessing individual accounts receivable over a specific aging and amount. Accounts 
receivable are written off on a case-by-case basis, net of any amounts that may be collected.

deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. 
 
GAAP requires, a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and 
measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company records a 
liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured pursuant to ASC 740 and 
the tax position taken or expected to be taken on the Company's tax return. The Company's policy 
for classifying interest and penalties associated with unrecognized income tax benefits is to include 
such items as tax expense.

To the extent that the assessment of such tax positions changes, the change in estimate is recorded 
in the period in which the determination is made. The Company establishes reserves for tax-related 
uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. 
These reserves are established when the Company believes that certain positions might be 
challenged despite the Company's belief that the tax return positions are fully supportable The 
reserves are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the outcome of a tax audit. 
The income tax provision includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are 
considered appropriate. 
 
The Company recognizes interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within 
the income tax provision. The Company recognized no material interest and penalties for the year 
ending December 31, 2017.

On February 12, 2016, the Company entered into a First Amendment ("Amendment") to the January 
15, 2016 credit agreement between the Company and Telestream and SVB as the Issuing Lender 
and Administrative agent for the lending group Under the Amendment, the aggregate principal 
available under the term loans increased by $14,259,000 to $132,500,000 in total Two of the 
existing lenders and two new lenders participated in the increase in the loan commitment. As part 
of the Amendment, the Company paid commitments fees to the lenders of 2% of the increased 
amount and 0.25% of the outstanding principal before the amendment, as well as the legal fees for 
the lender. The total lender fees and expenses recorded as a discount from the loan proceeds was 
approximately $765,000.

Under the Amendment, the applicable margins for calculating interest rates increased by 0.34% and 
the resulting rate applicable to the loan increased to 7.77% per annum effective February 13, 2016. 
The quarterly principal payment amount was also increased from approximately $753,000 to 
approximately $828,000 starting with the March 31, 2016 payment. The fixed charge and leverage 
ratios for covenant purposes were also adjusted to reflect the new borrowings starting with the 
quarter ending March 31, 2016. 
 
The term loan matures January 15, 2020 and principal payments, initially set at approximately 
$828,000 per quarter, are payable for quarters ending March 31, 2016 to December 31, 2019. The 
loan also calls for mandatory annual principal payments of excess cash. These payments, if made, 
result in a prorata reduction of future quarterly principal payments. Interest expense incurred during 
the years ended December 31, 2017 totaled approximately $13,932,000. 
 
On March 24, 2017 the Company completed the acquisition of all the issued and outstanding shares 
of IneoQuest Technologies, Inc. (IneoQuest) forl the purchase price of $63,648,000. The purchase 
a

principal payment amount was also decreased from approximately $828,000 to approximately 
$468,000 starting with the June 30, 2017 payment. The fixed charge and leverage ratios for covenant 
purposes were also adjusted to reflect the new borrowings starting with the quarter ending March

The term loan matures on March 24, 2022 and principal payments, initially set at approximately 
$468,000 per quarter, are payable for quarters ending December 31, 2017 to March 31, 2018. The 
loan also calls for mandatory annual principal payments of excess cash. These payments, if made, 
result in a pro-rata reduction of future quarterly principal payments.

$5,167,000 and Massachusetts and Calif ornia state NOLs of $2,607,000. At December 31, 2017 the 
l
u
J
Company had federal research tax credit carryforwards of $3,596,000 and Massachusetts and 
California state research tax credit carryforwards of approximately $6,121,000. The California and 
Massachusetts state credits have no expiration date, except for a small portion of the Massachusetts 
credits that expire in 5 years. Utilization of the credits may be subject to annual limitation due to 
the ownership percentage change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and 
similar state provisions The annual limitation will not result in the expiration of the California 
credits or Massachusetts before utilization as there is no expiration date. A valuation allowance of 
$1,265,000 has been recorded against the Deferred Tax asset for the Massachusetts credits for risk 
of not generating enough taxable income to obtain the benefit. 
 
In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely 
than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized The ultimate 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during 
the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Based upon the reversal of 
deferred tax liabilities and expected future income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets 
are deductible, management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the 
benefits of these deferred tax assets (net of the valuation allowance referenced above) at 
December 31, 2017.

6. Income Taxes (continued) 
 
The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, state jurisdictions, and foreign 
jurisdictions As of December 31, 2017 the Company was no longer subject to income tax 
examinations for taxable years before 2014 for U.S. federal taxing authorities, and taxable years 
generally before 2013 in the case of state taxing authorities. Net operating losses generated on a tax 
return basis by the Company for the tax years 2012 to 2016 remain open to examination by the major 
domestic taxing jurisdictions Credits generated in years back to 2002 remain unused and credits 
used in open year arose in years back to 2007 and remain subject to examination. 
 
As of December 31, 2017 the Company made no provision for a cumulative total of approximately 
$935,000 of undistributed earnings for certain non-U.S. subsidiaries, which are considered to be 
permanently reinvested 
 
As of December 31, 2017, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $810,000 
(includes $50,000 of interest and penalties). As of December 31, 2017 the amount of unrecognized 
tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect thle effective tax rate was $810,000 The Company

taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and a one-time transition tax on the 
mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings. The Company has calculated its best 
estimate of the impact of the Act in its year end income tax provision in accordance with its 
understanding of the Act and guidance available as of the date of this filing. 
 
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ("SAB 118") was issued to address the application of U.S. GAAP 
in situations when the company does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or 
analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain 
income tax effects of the Act. The FASB has indicated that private companies may also apply SAB 
118, which established that companies' financial statements should include: 
 
1. Income tax effects of TCJA for which the ASC 740 accounting is complete; 
2. Provisional income tax effects for specific TCJA components for which the ASC 740 
accounting is incomplete but a reasonable estimate can be made; or 
3. For specific TCJA components for which a reasonable estimate cannot be made, the 
registrant should apply pre-TCJA law when determining the tax effects to include in the 
financial statements.

6. Income Taxes (continued) 
 
In accordance with SAB 118, the Company has determined that the $5,490,000 benefit recorded in 
connection with the re-measurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities was a provisional 
amount and a reasonable estimate at December 31, 2017. Additional work is necessary for a more 
detailed analysis of its deferred tax assets and liabilities. In addition, the Company has determined 
that its calculation of the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings is provisional as it requires 
additional analysis. The provisional amount related to the one-time transition tax on the mandatory 
deemed repatriation of foreign earnings was immaterial based on cumulative foreign deficits from 
its foreign subsidiaries. Any subsequent adjustment to these amounts may be recorded to current 
tax expense in the quarter of 2018 when the analysis is complete. 
 
The Act subjects a U.S. shareholder to tax on global intangible low-taxed income ("GILTI") earned 
by certain foreign subsidiaries. The FASB Staff Q&A, Topic 740, No. 5, Accounting for Global 
Intangible Low-Taxed Income, states that an entity can make an accounting policy election to either 
recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse as GILTI in future years 
or provide for the tax expense related to GILTI inl the year the tax is incurred. Given the complexity 
a
y
i

of the GILTI provisions, the Company is still evaluaeting the effects of the GILTI provisions and 
n

e r

have not yet determined its accounting pdolicy. At December 31, 2017, because the Company is still

J
On January 16, 2015 (inception) the Company's stockholders approved the Thunder Parent Inc. 2015 
Equity Incentive Plan (the "2015 Plan"). The 2015 Plan allows for the issuance of stock options, 
SARs, restricted stock awards, unrestricted stock awards, stock units including restricted stock units, 
performance awards and awards up to 16,923,500 shares of common stock to employees, officers, 
directors, consultants and advisers of the Company. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had 
reserved approximately 3,150,000 shares of common stock available for future issuance of equity 
awards under the 2015 Plan. 
 
For the year ended December 31, 2017, total stock-based compensation expense for stock options 
was approximately $903,000. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recognized tax 
benefits associated with stock options of approximately $235,000.

7. Equity Incentive Plan (continued) 
 
The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to determine the fair value of 
the Company's stock option awards This model requires the input of subjective assumptions, 
including expected stock price volatility and the estimated term of each award. The estimated fair 
value of the Company's stock-based awards, less expected forfeitures, is amortized over the awards' 
vesting period on a straight-line basis. Expected volatilities are based on the average of comparable 
company's historical stock price volatility and implied volatility from traded options in its stock. 
The Company uses historical data to estimate the expected term of options granted within the 
valuation model. The risk-free interest rate for periods commensurate with the expected term of the 
option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield rate in effect at the time of grant. The expected dividend 
yield is zero, as the Company currently does not pay a dividend and does not anticipate doing so in 
the future. 
 
Stock options are issued with a maximum term of 10 years The Company grants options with 
service and performance-based vesting components. Generally, the service-based component vests 
at a rate of 20% annually over five years. The plerformance-based component will vest at a rate of 
a
y
i
t
50% upon the achievement of certain financial targetes. The options cease vesting once the grantee

e r
u
is no longer an employee or providing sedrvices to the Company.
